-- this error message does not make any sense

-- changed scope to openid+profile+email

-- changed redirec_uri to oktapreview and it works till I get to:

https://trustedkey.oktapreview.com/state=some_state&error=access_denied&error_description=Unable+to+process+the+username+transform.

-- I think this means that the username already exists.

-- I changed my existing user tom.smith@okta.com -> tom.smith@oktademo.com

-- Added profile and email scopes to the IDP setup in Okta

https://trustedkey.oktapreview.com/state=some_state&error=jit_failure&error_description=Unable+to+JIT+the+user.

-- Added given_name and family_name in the scopes to the IDP setup in okta
^^^^^^did not need to do this, removed^^^^^^^^^

-- According to Okta, JIT was failing bc I did not have fn and LN.

-- I scanned my drivers license and therefore added fn and ln to my profile

It works!
